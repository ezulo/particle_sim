# Particle Sim

No idea what it's for yet, but I have some ideas

Uses SFML v3.0.2-1 and builds with clang 20.1.8

# Notes

* This compiles, does not work right
* Need to use the new priority queue method (ParticleSim.cpp)
* Add a new update method: collect all possible collisions, and pop them off the queue
